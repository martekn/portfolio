  "Hey! My name is Marte and I'm a frontend developer who recently graduated from Noroff Front End Development program. I completed the program online, which gave me the flexibility to learn at my own pace and dive deep into topics that interested me.",

  "Through my studies and personal projects, I've grown to care deeply about accessibility, organization, and consistency. I strive to make sure my projects are not only functional but also user-friendly and inclusive for everyone. Continuous learning and improvement are key to my approach, and I'm always looking for ways to enhance my skills and knowledge.",

  "Outside of coding, I'm a bit of an introvert who enjoys quiet, structured environments. I thrive on predictability and having a plan. I have a soft spot for animals and music, they bring me joy and comfort. When I'm not working on projects, you'll likely find me gaming, listening to music, or spending time with family, friends, and my four pets (two cats and two dogs). Reading and crafting projects are also hobbies I enjoy, although they come and go depending on my mood."
